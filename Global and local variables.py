# Global Variables
# Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.

# Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

# Example
# Create a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the function

x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

# If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be 
# local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name 
# will remain as it was, global and with the original value.

# Example
# Create a variable inside a function, with the same name as the global variable

x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)


# local variables

# if we create a varribles inside a function can be used only inside it
# but we cannot use it outside a function and these type of
